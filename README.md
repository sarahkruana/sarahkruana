### Hello! 
#### I'm currently studying Computer Science with a concentration in AI and a minor in Cell and Molecular Biology. Currently, I want to expand and utilize the knowledge I'm gaining during classes on real world projects. Eventually however, I want to bridge the gap between labs and computers by using AI as a tool to help parse and analyze DNA.
